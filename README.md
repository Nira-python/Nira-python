## Niranjana (Nira) Kulkarni 🌱

I'm an Applied Mathematics PhD applicant and am currently delving deep into nonlinear partial differential equations! 

I completed my Master's of Science in Mathematics from [Texas A&M](https://www.math.tamu.edu/) in December 2024, and in Spring 2022 finished my BS in Applied Math at [University of California, Davis](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/).

Master's thesis: "On The Radial Reduction of the Linearization at a Solitary Wave in the Nonlinear Dirac Equation in Three Spatial Dimensions" under the supervision of [Dr. Andrew Comech](https://people.tamu.edu/~comech//homepage.html).
