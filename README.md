## Niranjana (Nira) Kulkarni üå±

I'm an Applied Mathematics PhD applicant, currently delving deep into nonlinear partial differential equations! 

I completed my Master of Science in Mathematics from [Texas A&M](https://www.math.tamu.edu/) in December 2024, and in Spring 2022 finished my BS in Applied Math at [University of California, Davis](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/).

Article submitted 30 Dec 2024 to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21170) : "On spectral stability of one- and bi-frequency solitary waves in Soler model in (3+1)D"

Article submitted 30 Dec 2024 to *Physical Review Letters* : "Stable bi-frequency spinor modes as Dark Matter candidates"

Master's thesis: "On The Radial Reduction of the Linearization at a Solitary Wave in the Nonlinear Dirac Equation in Three Spatial Dimensions" under the supervision of [Dr. Andrew Comech](https://people.tamu.edu/~comech//homepage.html).
